        In the depths of dispair they brought the promise of hope.
        <br>
        In exchange for giving up your children they offered wealth

            <img src="Pictures/industial-school.jpg" >
        </div>
        <br>
        In exchange for your gold they offered happiness forged from pyrite

            </div>
        The deals they have made with man have been obfuscated by the dark miasma constantly spewing from their maws,
        <br>
        as they are an artificial organism that cares not who dies, as long as their greed is perpetually satiated.
        <div class="pic">
            <img src="Pictures/disney.png" >
            </div>
        <br>
        They have woven their dark tendrils deep into the fabric of all that is, and watch with gluttonous eyes our every move.
        <br>

        Their goals are simple
        <br> 
        to consume your soul
        <br>  bit by bit
        <br>  until they are full.
        <br>
        But the beasts have no stomach
        <br>  their appetite can never truly be satiated.
        <br>
        Thus each day they grow more cruel
        <br>  finding new ways to lodge themselves into the hearts of men so they may take another bite.

        They are more than Religion
        <br>
        <br> 
        They are more than Evil
        <br>
        <br> 
        They are more than Rulers
        <br>
        <br> 
        They are more than Devils
        <br>
        <br> 
        They are Dragons
        <br> 
        <br>
        God save us
